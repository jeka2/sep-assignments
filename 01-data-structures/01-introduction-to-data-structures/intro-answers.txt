1. In the Line class, one can access and manipulate data by a variety of created methods. These inlude 'join',
'leave', 'front', 'middle', 'back', 'seach', and 'index', with all of them being self-referencial in the context
of a waiting line. In the Screen class, one can user 'insert', and 'at' which insert and locate the needed pixel
respectively.
2. In the Line class, a conveniently names 'search' method can be utilized. All one needs to do is pass a persons
name into it. As for the Screen class, there is a method 'at', which is used to track the pixel at the given
location with only the location itself in (length, width) format needed for proper execution.
3. In the grand scheme of things, these two data structures are fairly universal in application to similar tasks.
'line' can be replaced by an order of giant ice cream with unique flavors stacked one upon another, and many other
applications.The 'screen' class can be substituted with any other application of inserting things and searching 
into a pre-defined 2-D space and values in a cartesian coordinat system, and can even be flatten to a 1-D space 
or expanded to a 3-D space with slight modifications.
